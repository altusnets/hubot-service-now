# hubot-service-now
A hubot script to perform record lookups to a Service Now Instance.

## Installation
Add `hubot-service-now` to your `external-scripts.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "hubot": ">=2 <3",
  "hubot-redis-brain": "0.0.3",
  "hubot-service-now": "^1.0.0"
}
```

Install the package: `npm install hubot-service-now --save`

### Required Environment Variables
In order to use this script, you will need to set a few environment variables:

|Environment Variable|Purpose|
|--------------------|-------|
|`HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_INSTANCE`|Service Now subdomain that represents instance. For example, `devtest` of `devtest.service-now.com`|
|`HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_DOMAIN`|Use instead of `HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_INSTANCE`; used to override the full FQDN used to connect to Service Now, useful for internal proxies|
|`HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_USER`|User with API access rights|
|`HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_PASSWORD`|Password associated with above user|

### Testing
This repository has a Gruntfile that describes a `test` task, which can be used for testing. The script is tested with `chai`, `nock`, and `hubot-test-helper`, and all new features should have associated tests, before the feature is released.
To test the script, run `grunt test` from the repository root.

## Supported Records and Fields
The script currently supports retreiving these record types: CHG, INC, PRB, RITM, and the following fields are returned for each:


## Sample Interaction
```
user1>> hubot snow INC0000001
hubot>>
Found INC0000001:
Short Description: The hamburger has been stolen
Assigned to: Hamburger Recovery
Opened By: Ian Ward
Opened At: 1970-01-01 00:00:00
Priority: 1
State: Work in Progress
```

## Implicit/Explicit Listen Toggle
By default, hubot will only listen for explicit requests (a channel/group mention or direct message, plus the trigger phrase: sn, snow, service now). However, you can optionally enable implicit operation on a per-channel basis. This relies on persistence via a hubot brain (hubot-redis-brain is the only one tested).
This per-channel toggle is triggered by the trigger phrase (case insensitive: sn, snow, service now), plus "listen".

A sample interaction is as follows:
```
user1>> INC0000001
user1>> Bill, please work on INC0000001
user1>> hubot service now listen
hubot>> I will listen for Service Now
user1>> INC0000001
